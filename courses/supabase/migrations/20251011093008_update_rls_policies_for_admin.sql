  # Update RLS Policies for Admin Content Management

  1. Changes
    - Keep existing public read access policy for all users
    - Note: Authentication is handled client-side with session storage
    - No changes needed to RLS as blog_posts remain publicly readable
    - Future: Can add authenticated user policies when Supabase Auth is fully integrated

  2. Security
    - Public read access remains enabled for all users (authenticated and anonymous)
    - This allows the learning platform to be freely accessible
    - Admin authentication is handled at the application level
    - When proper Supabase Auth is added, additional policies can restrict write operations

  3. Notes
    - Current implementation uses session storage for admin authentication
    - This migration documents the security model
    - RLS policies already configured correctly from previous migrations
