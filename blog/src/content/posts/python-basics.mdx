# Getting Started with Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and for good reason! It's easy to learn, versatile, and used in everything from web development to artificial intelligence.

## Why Python?

1. **Beginner-friendly syntax** - Python reads almost like English
2. **Huge community** - Tons of resources and help available
3. **Versatile** - Used in web dev, data science, AI, and more
4. **In-demand skill** - Top companies use Python

## Your First Python Program

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

That's it! Just one line of code.

## Variables and Data Types

Variables store information. Here are the basic types:

```python
name = "Stemsphere"     # String (text)
age = 2                  # Integer (whole number)
price = 19.99           # Float (decimal)
is_active = True        # Boolean (true/false)
```

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning! In future tutorials, we'll cover:
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- Working with files
- Building simple projects
